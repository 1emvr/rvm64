# rvm64
very simple virtual machine for emulating risc-v code in Windows environments.

### Testing Phase

## Requirements:
- clang++
- mingw-w64
- musl (used for creating independent risc-v binaries) - https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain

## Usage:
It's recommended to use linux/wsl for toolchains used to build rvm64.

## TODO:
-build scripts
